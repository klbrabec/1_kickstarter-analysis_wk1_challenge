An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Brief Description of Project

In order to determine the potential success of a Kickstarter campaign, it is important to review the information available for previous campaigns.  This project reviews the success and failure of a variety of different types of campaigns, but focuses on Theater projects, particularly musicals and plays.  

As part of the analysis, we review the following: 
*  Goals
*  Pledges 
*  Percentage Funded
*  Success/Failure

### Data Set Synopsis
The 4113 records that were included in the data set studied, break out into the following parent categories.

As you can see, the amount of records that fall into the theater category give us a robust volume of data to make determinations of Project strategy based on actual results. 

### Timing Analysis 
While Kickstarter programs can be started at any time, it is best to target them at times when crowdsourced funding is being participated in.  Examining the theater category of Kickstarter programs in the Theater category,  the most successful programs were launched during the May/June time frame, regardless of year.

### Goal Analysis 
For Theater campaigns that were successfully funded, goals were distributed fairly evenly across the range.  This is an indication that the goals were within a range that crowdsourced funding was able to reach.  

For Theater campaigns that were not successfully funded, goals were not distributed evenly.  This is an indication that not all goals were realistic when they were orginally defined
